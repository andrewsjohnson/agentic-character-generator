# Equipment & Armor

## Armor Class (AC) Calculation

### Unarmored

```
AC = 10 + Dexterity modifier
```

### Light Armor

```
AC = armor base AC + Dexterity modifier
```

### Medium Armor

```
AC = armor base AC + Dexterity modifier (max +2)
```

### Heavy Armor

```
AC = armor base AC (Dexterity modifier not added)
```

Some heavy armor requires a minimum Strength score; without it, speed is reduced.

### Shield

```
+2 AC (stacks with any armor or unarmored AC)
```

### Alternative AC Calculations

Some class features provide alternative AC formulas (e.g., Monk's Unarmored Defense, Barbarian's Unarmored Defense). If you have multiple AC calculations, you choose **only one** to use at a time.

## Armor Training

You must have training with an armor category to gain its AC benefit. Armor training comes from your class. Wearing armor without training negates its defensive bonuses.

## Weapon Attack Rolls

### Melee Weapons

```
Melee attack bonus = Strength modifier + Proficiency Bonus
```

### Ranged Weapons

```
Ranged attack bonus = Dexterity modifier + Proficiency Bonus
```

> Some weapon properties (e.g., Finesse) allow using a different ability modifier. Check the weapon's property list.

## Weapon Damage

Add the **same ability modifier** used for the attack roll to the damage roll.

```
Damage = weapon damage die + ability modifier
```

## Starting Equipment

Equipment comes from two sources at level 1:

1. **Background** starting equipment
2. **Class** starting equipment

Any coins received can be spent immediately on items from the "Equipment" chapter.

### Starting Equipment at Higher Levels

| Starting Level | Equipment and Money                                      | Magic Items                                  |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 2–4            | Normal starting equipment                                | 1 Common                                     |
| 5–10           | 500 GP + 1d10 × 25 GP + normal starting equipment       | 1 Common, 1 Uncommon                         |
| 11–16          | 5,000 GP + 1d10 × 250 GP + normal starting equipment    | 2 Common, 3 Uncommon, 1 Rare                 |
| 17–20          | 20,000 GP + 1d10 × 250 GP + normal starting equipment   | 2 Common, 4 Uncommon, 3 Rare, 1 Very Rare   |

## Notes for Agents

- Full armor table (light/medium/heavy armor AC values, Stealth disadvantage, Strength requirements) is in the "Equipment" chapter, not included in this SRD excerpt.
- Full weapon table (damage dice, properties like Finesse, Light, Two-Handed, etc.) is also in the "Equipment" chapter.
- Firearms exist but are too expensive for level 1 characters; GM permission required.
