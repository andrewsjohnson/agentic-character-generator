# Species

## Available Species

Dragonborn, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Goliath, Halfling, Human, Orc, Tiefling.

## What Species Determines

- **Size** (Small or Medium — record on character sheet)
- **Speed** (base walking speed in feet)
- **Species Traits** (unique species features; see each species entry in "Character Origins")

## Ability Score Adjustments

In the 2024 SRD (5.2), species do **not** grant fixed ability score bonuses. Instead, ability score increases come from **backgrounds** (see `backgrounds.md`).

Your background lists three abilities; you increase one by +2 and another by +1, or all three by +1. No score can exceed 20.

## Languages

Every character knows **Common** plus **two additional languages** chosen or rolled from the Standard Languages table:

| d12  | Language              |
|------|-----------------------|
| —    | Common (automatic)    |
| 1    | Common Sign Language  |
| 2    | Draconic              |
| 3–4  | Dwarvish              |
| 5–6  | Elvish                |
| 7    | Giant                 |
| 8    | Gnomish               |
| 9    | Goblin                |
| 10–11| Halfling              |
| 12   | Orc                   |

### Rare Languages

Abyssal, Celestial, Deep Speech, Druidic, Infernal, Primordial (includes Aquan, Auran, Ignan, Terran), Sylvan, Thieves' Cant, Undercommon.

Rare languages require a specific feature to learn.

## Notes for Agents

- Species choice affects **size**, **speed**, and **species traits** only.
- Ability score bonuses are handled entirely by backgrounds in this edition.
- Detailed species traits (e.g., Darkvision, breath weapons, resistance) are defined in the full "Character Origins" chapter, not included in this SRD excerpt.
