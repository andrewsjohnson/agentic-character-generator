## Spellcasting Ability by Class

| Class    | Spellcasting Ability |
|----------|----------------------|
| Bard     | Charisma             |
| Cleric   | Wisdom               |
| Druid    | Wisdom               |
| Paladin  | Charisma             |
| Ranger   | Wisdom               |
| Sorcerer | Charisma             |
| Warlock  | Charisma             |
| Wizard   | Intelligence         |

> Barbarian, Fighter, Monk, and Rogue do not have the Spellcasting feature at level 1 (subclasses may grant it later).

## Spell Slots, Cantrips, and Prepared Spells

- The number of **spell slots**, **cantrips known**, and **spells you can prepare** at level 1 are listed in each class's features table in "Classes."
- Choose cantrips and prepared spells at character creation and record them.

## Pact Magic (Warlock)

Warlocks use **Pact Magic** instead of the standard Spellcasting feature. Pact Magic spell slots are separate and recharge on a Short Rest. The specific slot count and level are in the Warlock class table.

## Multiclass Spellcasting

When multiclassing with multiple Spellcasting classes, determine combined spell slots as follows:

1. Add together: all levels in Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard + half your levels (round up) in Paladin and Ranger.
2. Look up the total in the Multiclass Spellcaster table below.
3. **Spells prepared** are still determined per-class individually.

### Pact Magic + Spellcasting

Warlock Pact Magic slots can be used to cast spells from Spellcasting classes, and vice versa.

## Notes for Agents

- Cantrip power scales with **total character level**, not class level.
- Higher-level multiclass slots can be used to upcast lower-level prepared spells.
- Specific cantrip/spell lists and slots-per-level for single-class characters are in each class's features table.
