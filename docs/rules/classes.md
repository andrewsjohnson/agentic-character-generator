## Armor Training

Each class specifies which categories of armor the character can wear effectively. Armor training is noted in the class description in "Classes." Wearing armor without training negates its defensive bonuses.

## Subclass

Subclass is chosen at **level 3** (or as specified by the class). A level 1 character does not yet have a subclass unless starting at level 3+.

## Multiclassing Prerequisite

To multiclass into a new class, you must have a score of **13 or higher** in the primary ability of both your current class(es) and the new class.

## Notes for Agents

- Detailed level 1 class features (e.g., Rage, Spellcasting, Sneak Attack) are defined in the full "Classes" chapter, not included in this SRD excerpt.
- Proficiencies granted by each class are listed in the class description.
- Saving throw proficiencies are class-specific and found in each class's entry.
