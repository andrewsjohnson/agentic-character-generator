## Notes for Agents

- Background is the **sole source of ability score increases** in this edition (species does not grant them).
- The background's feat is an origin feat chosen at character creation.
- Specific background descriptions (equipment lists, flavor text, detailed proficiencies) are in the full "Character Origins" chapter, not included in this SRD excerpt.
- When choosing a background, prioritize matching one of the three listed abilities to the class's primary ability.
