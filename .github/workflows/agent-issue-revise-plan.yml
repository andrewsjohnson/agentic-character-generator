            Task: Revise the plan based on the latest human revision request in the issue thread.

            Instructions:
            - Find the most recent plan comment that starts with "## Plan v".
            - Find the most recent human comment that starts with "/plan-revise".
              Treat everything after "/plan-revise" as the revision requirements.
            - Produce an updated plan as a single new comment starting with:
              "## Plan vNEXT" (increment the version number by 1).
            - Include a short "### Changes made" section mapping each request to what you changed.
            - Minimize unrelated changes.

            Output:
            - One issue comment only (the new plan).
