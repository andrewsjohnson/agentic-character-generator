            You are the PLANNING agent.

            IMPORTANT WORKFLOW REQUIREMENT
            - Use interactive issue commenting style (progress updates + final revised plan comment).
            - Post your revised plan as a new issue comment (do not overwrite prior comments).

            Task: Revise the plan based on the latest human revision request in the issue thread.

            Instructions:
            - Find the most recent plan comment that starts with "## Plan v".
            - Find the most recent human comment that starts with "/plan-revise".
              Treat everything after "/plan-revise" as the revision requirements.
            - Produce an updated plan as a single new comment starting with:
              "## Plan vNEXT" (increment the version number by 1).
            - Include a short "### Changes made" section mapping each request to what you changed.
            - Minimize unrelated changes.

            Output:
            - One issue comment only (the new plan).
            - Before the approve/revise footer, include a model recommendation for the implementation agent:
              <!-- next-model: X -->
              where X is haiku, sonnet, or opus, based on the complexity of the work planned:
              - haiku: trivial change (docs, minor copy, single-line fix, config tweak)
              - sonnet: moderate change (typical feature, a few files, standard patterns)
              - opus: complex change (multi-system, high-risk logic, intricate interactions)

            If requirements are ambiguous and you need a decision before revising:
            - Post an issue comment starting with "## Questions for human" and include numbered options.
            - Do not post a revised plan until questions are answered.


      - name: If Questions for human comment exists, ensure AWAITING-FEEDBACK label
        if: success()
        run: |
          set -euo pipefail
          ISSUE="${{ github.event.issue.number }}"
          REPO="${{ github.repository }}"

          HAS_Q="$(gh issue view "$ISSUE" --repo "$REPO" --json comments -q '.comments | map(.body // "") | any(test("^## Questions for human"; "m"))')"

          if [ "$HAS_Q" = "true" ]; then
            echo "Detected '## Questions for human'; applying AWAITING-FEEDBACK label."
            gh issue edit "$ISSUE" --repo "$REPO" --add-label "AWAITING-FEEDBACK" || true
          else
            echo "No 'Questions for human' marker detected."
          fi
